There is Party and Claim.
Party is a participant of some insurance claim.
Party has id and full name.
Claim has id and creation_date.
For a particular claim party will have some role. 
Role is witness, victim etc

At first you should model this simple domain in Scala

Then implement in Scala and Spark following tasks:
 - For a given claim, how many witness parties were witnesses in previous claims
